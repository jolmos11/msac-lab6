# Exercise 4 - Adding files

1. Look git status for your directory, and paste the contents below

        git status

2. Using VS Code, the command line, or your favorite code editor, create a new file named `fruits.txt`.

3. Check your git status, and paste the contents here

        Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        fruits.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

C:\Users\Jason\OneDrive\Documents\MTSAC\Fall 2022\CISW - 24L\msac-lab6>git add fruits.txt

C:\Users\Jason\OneDrive\Documents\MTSAC\Fall 2022\CISW - 24L\msac-lab6>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
       

4. Add the new file to your index

        git add fruits.txt

5. Check git status again, and paste the contents below

        On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   fruits.txt
